# MetaModels note list

This is the MetaModels note list implementation. 

The note list extends MetaModels by the possibility of adding individual data records (items) to a note list
in the FE output or also to pass them to a form. Possible uses for the note list range from a "normal note list" to
comparison lists, e.g. of product properties, to shopping basket functions.

# Installation

`composer require metamodels/notelist`
