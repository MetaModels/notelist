# MetaModels note list

This is the MetaModels note list implementation. 

The note list extends MetaModels by the possibility of adding individual data records (items) to a note list
in the FE output or also to pass them to a form. Possible uses for the note list range from a "normal note list" to
comparison lists, e.g. of product properties, to shopping basket functions.

Optionally, each note can be given additional values such as number, colour or comment using an individual form from
the form generator.

The data can be saved in the PHP session or in the Contao session of a logged-in member.

## Installation

Add with composer

`composer require metamodels/notelist` 

or search `metamodels/notelist` in Contao-Manager to install.
